          <h5>Prefixes:</h5>
          <p>Please note that the bulk of Spartan history is recovered from sources written by predominantly Athenian and non-Spartan citizens. Therefore, much of Sparta’s history is subject to approximation when it comes to dates and statistics of the time. Dates after 600 BC do become more accurate.</p>
          <h5>800 BC - 701 BC</h5>
          <p>- The Greek language re-emerges after the dark age and comes back not as Linear B but as the Greek alphabet adapted from the Phoenician abjad. </p>
          <p>- 820 BC Lycurgus laws are passed by Lycurgus after receiving them from the oracle at Delphi. Sparta’s conquest of the Eurotas river valley was completed around the beginning of the century including the neighbouring city of Amykla and the port of Gytheion. </p>
          <p>- War with Agors would break out around this time and the Spartans would capture Kynouria.</p>
          <p>- 750 to 724 BCE Sparta conquered the Messianic region (the “First Messenian War”).</p>
          <p>- 706 BC Sarta founded its only direct colony, Táras.</p>
          <h5>700 BC - 601 BC </h5>
          <p>- 670 BC - 669 BC Battle of Hysiae between Argos and Sparta. Was Sparta's first defeat against Argos.  </p>
          <p>- 669 BC - 650 BC First helot revolt (the "Second Messenian War”). Spart wins and divides Messenian into 9,000 lots (kleros) for Spartan citizens to watch over. Also, Tyrtaeus begins to write poems to help Sparta win the war.</p>
          <p>- 630 BC  Cyrene was founded by colonists from Thera; the order likely came from Sparta.</p>
          <h5> 600 BC - 501 BC</h5>
          <p>- 582 BC - 581 BC Sparta sends assistance to Corinth to fight against the tyrant reign that started in 747 BC génos of the Bacchiads and the current tyrant Kypselid. Which leads to a Sparta alliance with the new Oligarchy Corinth.</p>
          <p>- 550 BC a failed conquest of Tegea eventually leads to a Spartan alliance with the Arcadians. Additionally, Sparta monumentalizes the sanctuary of Apollo at Amyklai.</p>
          <p>- Around the middle of the century, Sparta controlled the lower half of the Peloponnese and was in close relations with the rest of the Peloponnese except with Argos.</p>
          <p>- 546 BC Stalemate with Argos ("Battle of the 300 Champions")</p>
          <p>- 510 BC - 500 BC the Peloponnese Alliance was formed with all city-states of the Peloponnese except Argos (Spartan enemy) and the northwest Peloponnese (Independent). </p>
          <h5> 500 BC - 478 BC</h5>
          <p>- 480 BC Second Persian Invasion of Greece starts. July/August Battles of Artemisium Greek (sea) loss and Thermopylae Greek (land) loss. September/October Battle of Salamis Greek (sea) victory. Additionally, an excursus to Himera in Sicily was going on.</p>
          <p>- 479 BC July/August Battles of Plataea Greek (land) victory and Mykale Greek (sea) victory.</p>
          <p>- 478 BC The "Serpent Column" is put up at Delphi dedicated to the Greek allies' victory against the Persians.</p>
